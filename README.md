# Client-Server
The server asks the user for the number of the symbol to be changed and the symbol to be replaced. The client sends the entered data to the server. The server accesses the file (the file is stored on the server, in the text file), takes a sentence from the file and replaces each K-th symbol in the word with a new one (which was received from the client). The server sends the modified text to the client and the client writes the result to its file.
